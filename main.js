//Space complxity is the totla space used by an algorithm relative to the size of the unit

//in lame mans terms, it's the total amount of working memory the algorithm needs

//it's measured in the same way as time complexity - using the Big O (worst case scenario to best case scenario).

//Only, it's focused on memory space rather than time
